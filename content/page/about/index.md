UKMac.blog has been around in many versions although previously at [https://ukmac.net](https://ukmac.net) and using many web publishing systems since around 2005.

My interest in Macs goes back before the beginning of this site but really took off when I bought my first 17" G5 iMac.

Since then I have spent more money than I would like to add up on Apple equipment but have never regretted any of it. My current setup includes a 16" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro), a fifth gen iPad mini, Airpods Pro and currently a work issued iPhone 11 (though I have just ordered a new iPhone 15 Plus which should be here sometime next week with a bit of luck). I have also owned a variety of MacBooks, iMacs and Mac Minis along the way.

At work I have been an IT manager for over 30 years, 26 years in the NHS, 6 years in the charity sector and now the Head of IT for one of the countries largest social care providers. Work life revolves around Windows PCs and services such as Office 365, so I have a broad knowledge of the other side of the fence too.
