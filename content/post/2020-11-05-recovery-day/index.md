Earlier in the year long before lockdown (that seems such a long time ago now) one of my co-workers at [The Camphill Village Trust](https://www.camphillvillagetrust.org.uk) asked if I would be interested in doing a sponsored bike ride for the charities 65th anniversary which is this year. I was of course up for it and we originally planned on an early Summer event riding from our offices in Stourbridge to one of our sites in Gloucestershire (Taurus Crafts) which was coincidentally 65 miles away (105k).

Shortly after making these preliminary plans we went into the first national lockdown and the plans got parked for another day. Yesterday we finally managed to fit the ride in and so far have raised over Â£1000 as well.

The ride we undertook was planned on Komoot and is [available here](https://www.komoot.com/tour/279396580) if anyone is interested. Our full Strava recording is [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/4285459080). No records broken as you can see, but that wasn't the point of the day and we did enjoy a glorious crisp and sunny autumn morning (although the afternoon wasn't quite as favourable).
