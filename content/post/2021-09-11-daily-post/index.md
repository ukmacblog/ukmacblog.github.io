Badminton at Oakengates Leisure Centre with the kids this morning then a trip over to eldest's new house to help with sorting the garden which was a tad overgrown.

Still loving the iPad Pro and Apple Magic keyboard and so glad I finally overcame the reservations over price and bought one ( though it was helped by the fact that I got mine for half price as a second user unit through Amazon ). I am looking forward to the forthcoming release of macOS Monterey and the new Universal Control feature.

I finished the Stephen King's new book, Billy Summers on Audible on the drive to Yorkshire this week. Unusual for King that there is no supernatural or horror element ( apart from a few very brief references to The Shining ) but I really enjoyed it none the less. One of those Audible books that I couldn't wait to get into the car to carry on listening to and was gutted when it finished.
