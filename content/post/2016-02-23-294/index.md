Not at all surprising to hear [reports coming through](http://www.macworld.com/article/3036745/security/apple-is-reportedly-fighting-12-more-iphone-data-extraction-orders.html#tk.rss_all) that there are buckets of iPhones being held by US authorities in readiness for the potential flood gates opening if Apple are forced to back down and provide the FBI with access to the contents of the San Bernadino case iPhone....

I imagine this is exactly what Tim Cook was hoping to pre-empt by taking the stand that he has against the FBI. It will certainly be interesting to see how this all pans out.
