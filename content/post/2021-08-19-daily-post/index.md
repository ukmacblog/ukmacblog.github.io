## St Albans

I am staying at the Jury's Inn in Watford and just back from evening meal in the bar that was pretty rubbish. I ordered burger and chips for Â£15. The burger was overcooked, dry and tasteless and the chips had been covered in salt ( which I dont eat on food ) so were pretty much inedible. I should have taken myself out into town to find somewhere to eat but after an early start and a long day I couldn't be bothered and opted for the easy option of eating in the hotel. I'll never learn, hotel food is generally pretty meh and often worse than that. Would have been better off with a McDonalds !
