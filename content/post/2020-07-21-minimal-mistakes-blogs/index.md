Now I have got a barebones Jekyll site running, DNS sorted and old Wordpress posts migrated its time to do a bit of personalisation. Like a lot of Jekyll blogs I have started with the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) which is a nice starting point.

As a non-expert in the field of web development I know what I want to do and roughly how to achieve it but working out the detail of how to make the changes I need, especially where the theme is a remote Jekyl theme, is a challenge. This post includes a number of sites that I have found that have helped me to find the solutions to this.
