Just discovered that you can change individual folder permissions in Sharepoint Groups Document Library using the Manage Access panel. I had been under the impression that to make changes like this you needed to drop into the Advanced Permissions settings ( something that most of the users in my organisation would not cope with easily ).

[This Microsoft article shows how to do it](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-folders-to-create-read-only-files-for-students-or-other-team-members-0e7791d7-8c9c-4749-9bca-984289477988). I will definitely be making use of this now I know about it, and helping my users to use it too.
