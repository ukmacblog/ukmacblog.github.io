[Louisiana declares emergency over cyberattacks targeting schools](https://statescoop.com/louisiana-declares-emergency-over-cyberattacks-targeting-schools/)

Things seem to be going pretty badly for a lot of small states in America at the moment. As a regular listener to 
[Security Now](https://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) it seems there aren't many weeks that go by at the moment where one state or another isn't being crippled by ransomware. As they have discussed there is money to be made and it seems some governers are paying the ransom rather than trying to recover manually. Either way there are some significant sums of money involved in responding to this events and it seems that cyber insurance policies may not continue to be the way out in the future.
