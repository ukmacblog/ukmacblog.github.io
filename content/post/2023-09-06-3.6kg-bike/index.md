[TriRig](https://tririg.com/) are an American company who specialise in aero parts for triathlon bikes but in this video they show off an amazing looking machine that weighs just 3.6kg. Quite a feat especially when you consider this is a fully functional bike, although I think that saddle looks a little less than comfortable.
