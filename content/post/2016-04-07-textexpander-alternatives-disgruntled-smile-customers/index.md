title: TextExpander Alternatives for Disgruntled Smile Customers
categories:
- Apple
---

Over the last couple of days there has been a lot written about the 
[Smile Software](https://smilesoftware.com/) decision to move to a subscription model for version 6 of 
[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/), their popular text snippet app for OS X and iOS. Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like 
[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) pay its way are not simple and I really don't know if the change was actually an unavoidable option, but regardless of the reasons behind the decision it is fairly clear that a fair number of Smiles previous customers will be thinking twice about the upgrade and looking at alternative options.

There are a few alternatives to 
[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) and one of the main ones, 
[Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) from 
[Ergonis](http://www.ergonis.com) are 
[offering a discount](https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W) to existing TextExpander users to move to their product during April.

The app is normally EUR 24.99 for a single user or EUR 37.99 for a family pack so the reduction makes it EUR 18.75 and EUR 28.50 respectively. To access the offer 
[go to this link](https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W) before the end of the month.

If you are not happy spending this much on an alternative then a cheaper option is 
[aText](http://www.trankynam.com/atext/) at just $4.99.###UPDATE:


So it seems that the reasoning that Smile have given for the decision is based on the sharing features added in the updated version of TextExpander. They state 
[on this page](https://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/textexpander-release-follow-up) that the iCloud/Dropbox services would not allow them to implement the Group Sharing features that are the key new element of TextExpander.


>Group sharing in the new TextExpander is quite different than syncing via Dropbox or iCloud. Sharing, as it stands, couldnâ€™t work using either sync service.
