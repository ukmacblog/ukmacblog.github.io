UPDATE: I should apologise in advance for the non-Appleiness of this post, it seems I am in a sharing mood today !

I have a friend who shall remain nameless who constantly sends me awful Youtube clips but today he out did himself when he sent me this one ! This is an hilarious rant by 
[Youtuber Guzzy Bear Oh Yeh!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2i0uRFPpPS_1d60ziunEA)Â about a section of the new Jurassic World film that somehow got through editing without anyone spotting the fairly obvious racist connotations !

In case you wondered the friend who sent me this is asian...

Watch this, I was in stitches.
