Probably doomed to failure before I start but I am going to try and start a daily blog post again ( I know seen it before ! ). 

## Powerapps

Today I tried to go back to a Powerapp I had setup a little while ago but was politely refused by my Edge browser due to blocked third party cookies. Now I am certain this setting was enabled when I was last updating the Powerapp so I am not sure why it allowed me in before but now doesn't ? Anyway after a bit of faffing about I have temporarily re-enabled third party cookies in the Configuration Profile for Edge so I can get on, but I am going to have to come back to this later.

If you have any ideas on this one please let me know.

Many of the staff in my organisation end up using the Windows Mail app instead of Outlook or OWA and I would like to prevent this so I am planning on using this approach to remove Mail app from all PC's|
