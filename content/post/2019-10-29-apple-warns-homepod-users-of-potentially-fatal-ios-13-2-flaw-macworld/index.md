Apple has pulled the latest HomePod update and is warning users not to reset their speaker, lest they render it inoperable.

Found this after an hour of trying to work out why new multi-user support on HomePod didn't seem to be working. My HomePod is still on 12.4 so hasn't been updated fortunately.
