[Macworld](https://www.macworld.com) writer Christopher Phin [takes a fond look back](http://www.macworld.com/article/3048727/macs/the-imac-g4-apple-at-its-best.html) at what is probably one of the most iconic Macs ever made, the 
[iMac G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4). 

This was, and still is, Apple at its best: Producing something daring, novel, and utterly desirable. Nobody at the time could fail to be impressed almost to the point of shock by the sheer chutzpah of Appleâ€™s vision for a modern computer, and even today it strikes you as a fresh and exciting design.

The G4 was a stunning piece of industrial design and despite all the innovations of ever thinner and more powerful iMacs since it will almost certainly never be bettered.
