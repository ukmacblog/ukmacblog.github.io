We are probably only a month or so away from the release of the latest macOS version [Ventura](https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/macos-ventura-preview/) but the current latest version, Monterey, still has the same QuickLook issue that it has had since release.

Pretty regularly I will press Space on a file in the Finder to get a quick preview only to be greeted with a thumbnail image of the file. This has been a problem for me (and others) for some time now and whilst there is a quick fix (Force Quit the Finder) it really shouldn't be necessary after five major updates to the operating system should it ?

To be honest I am not sure if it is something specific to some of the software I use but I have seen it now on two MacBooks (my previous M1 MacBook Air and my current M1 MacBook Pro) and I have found lots of references to others with the same issue so it does seem to be a pretty widespread issue.
