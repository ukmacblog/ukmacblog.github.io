[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is the plain text markup syntax developed by 
[John Gruber](http://twitter.com/daringfireball) of 
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) over 10 years ago to help bloggers write in a readable format that could be easily converted to HTML. Since then it has grown in popularity and spawned a whole ecosystem of applications and tools for the easy management and production of Markdown formatted documents.

The syntax is simple to learn but if you want a nice concise set of quick video tutorials then 
[Wes Bos](http://twitter.com/wesbos) has put together a 
[set of 11 short](http://masteringmarkdown.com) ( between 1 and 6 mins long ) guides that take you quickly through the basics of Markdown to get you up and running with minimal effort.
