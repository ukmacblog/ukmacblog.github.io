This weekend I was supposed to be taking part in a 65 mile sponsored bike ride from Stourbridge to Lydney in Gloucestershire as part of the 65th anniversary celebrations for [The Camphill Village Trust](https://www.camphillvillagetrust.org.uk), the charity that I work for. Unfortunately the event was cancelled due to the arrival of [Storm Aiden](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2020/storm-aiden-wet-and-windy-weekend) and the remnants of ex-Hurricane Zeta.

Hopefully we will make the trip next weekend instead.
