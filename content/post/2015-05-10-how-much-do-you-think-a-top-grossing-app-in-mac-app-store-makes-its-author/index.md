Sam Soffes released a small app onto the Mac App Store this week and was shocked to find it quickly elevated into the top grossing apps list, so you can imagine his shock when he checked how much he had made the next day and found he had made only $302 on sales of 92 units !

Read his article here for the full details.

What I find strange about this article is the fact that he has 538 votes onÂ 
[Producthunt.com](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/redacted-2). Presumably these people are voting for an app they haven't actually used ?
