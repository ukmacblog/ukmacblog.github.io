title: For You Disappearing from iTunes after recent update
categories:
- Apple
---
Last night my MacBook's iTunes was updated with the latest release ( 12.2.1.16 ) and when it restarted I was prompted with the invitation to Join Apple Music trial. As I had already signed up I ignored this prompt and clicked through to iTunes assuming it was some sort of error, however what I noticed then was the For You and New sections at the top of the iTunes window were now missing.

Restarting iTunes didn't resolve this, nor did logging out of the the Store and back in again. After a number of attempts to recover the missing sections I went into the iTunes Store and clicked onto the 90 Day Trial link ( at the very bottom left of the store ) and hey presto the missing sections re-appeared again !

Anyone else experienced this or was this a one off for me ?
