[FreshBackMac](http://arkanath.com/FreshBackMac/) is a small utility written by Arkanath Pathak, a Computer Science student from eastern India, that refreshes your Mac desktop wallpaper at regular intervals using images from some of the best photo sites on the Internet.

You can choose from a range of categories such as Animals, Nature, Technology, Paintings and more and can set the refresh rate from as little as 2 minutes to 12 hours.

If you would like a fresh look to your Mac without the effort of searching for new images and setting up as desktop backgrounds this is the app for you.
