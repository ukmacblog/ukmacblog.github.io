It seems that Amazon was serious with recent threats to pull ads for media streaming devices that don't support their own [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Instant-Video/b/ref=nav_shopall_aiv?ie=UTF8&node=3010085031) service from the Amazon Store as today they have removed both 
[Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/tv/) and Chromecast devices.

Searches for 
[Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/tv/) on Amazon now list only Amazon's own 
[Fire TV](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00UH2O6T2/ref=topnav_storetab_kin_ftv) plus devices such as the Roku which already provide access to the Prime Video service. Amazon have released the following statement in response to questions about this change.>"It's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with 
[Prime Video](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Instant-Video/b/ref=nav_shopall_aiv?ie=UTF8&node=3010085031) in order to avoid customer confusion."

It seems somewhat coincidental that this should happen on the first day that the new Apple TV is available to buy in stores.

Apples requirement for a share of the revenues from subscription services accessed by their devices has been an issue in the past and it may be that this is a play by Amazon to try to force a better deal from Apple. It will certainly be interesting to see how this plays out and what the response from Apple and Google is to this.
