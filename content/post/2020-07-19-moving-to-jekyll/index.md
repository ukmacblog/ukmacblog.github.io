After many years of on and off dabbling with Wordpress blogs I have decided to make the move to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. Jekyll is very different to Wordpress and requires a completely different skill set to implement. It is easy enough to pickup if you have a good understanding of IT but probably not a simple job if you don't...

Typically I spend more time playing with setting up blogs than I do actually blogging. I always have good intentions which quickly fade after the fun of setting up the site is done. Perhaps this time will be different ? I have managed to import the few posts I had on Wordpress into Jekyll, albeit some of them needed manual tweaks and possibly some are still a little broken, but again this was more for the fun of doing it than the need to retain the posts.

At the moment I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on my Mac Mini for content editing and testing changes by running Jekyll locally ( there is a short delay after pushing updates to Github for the changes to reflect on your site so having a localhost version running is an essential configuration for most purposes.)

This site is currently (at the time this post was written) using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose. This theme is relatively basic compared to many Wordpress themes but has the functionality I need for this blog while still offering a degree of customisation, which is where I have got to at the moment. 

So far I am enjoying learning Jekyll and will aim to carry on developing this site, though I can't guarantee I won't get bored with it as I have done many times in the past. We'll have to wait and see.

Cheers
