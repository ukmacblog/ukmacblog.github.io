GifGrabber is a free utility available from the App Store that lets you easily create animated GIFs by capturing a user definable area of the screen. It is the perfect tool for creating a snip of your favourite movie or video clip or recording a quick screen cast to send to friends or colleagues to demonstrate how to do something on your Mac.
