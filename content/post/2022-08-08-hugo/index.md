Ukmac.net has moved to [Hugo CMS](https://gohugo.io)

I am currently doing a bit of tidying of old posts (fixing dates and youtube embeds) but hopefully this new iteration of my blog will be stable in the next day or so.

Ukmac.net is hosted on Github Pages, [this article](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-your-gh-pages-branch) explains how to setup Hugo to work with Github. I am no expert on Github but it didn't take me long to rebuild the site and replace the previous Jekyll version. Currently I am editing the site in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which works pretty well thanks to the excellent built in Github integration.
