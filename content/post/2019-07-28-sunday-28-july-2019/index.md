## PowerApps

So I am making some progress with learning PowerApps and have the start of a new app for the charity to use. Just came across this resource which will be worth having a look through, a showcase for what others have done with PowerApps

[Community Apps Gallery - Power Platform Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Community-Apps-Gallery/bd-p/AppFeedbackGallery)

[A useful quick linkÂ  to the PowerApps function reference on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/formula-reference)
