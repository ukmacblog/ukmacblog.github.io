[Traws Eryri](https://www.cyclinguk.org/traws-eryri-0 "Traws Eryri") is a new 200km off road across the North of Wales through the [Snowdonia National Park](https://snowdonia.gov.wales/visit/ "Snowdonia National Park"). It starts at Machynlleth and ends in Llandudno and includes 4,000m of climbing. It looks fabulous and I would love to find the time to do this.
