I just happened across this tidbit and though its not really Mac or Apple related I thought it was worth posting a quick note about itÂ because I expect many people in the UK may not be aware of the forthcoming changes to telephone call charges that come into force on 1st July 2015.

All the information you need can be found at 
[http://ukcalling.info](http://ukcalling.info). There are a range of changes being made to make the charges for 08 numbers clearer to UK residents amongst which is the change that makes 0800 and 0808 calls free to mobiles as well as landlines.

Good news for many people I would think.
