Just found 
[this article](https://www.thelazyadministrator.com/2019/08/08/set-corporate-lock-screen-wallpaper-with-intune-for-non-windows-10-enterprise-or-windows-10-education-machines/) on the 
[Lazy Administrator](https://www.thelazyadministrator.com/) that describes how to enforce a Windows lock screen wallpaper on Windows 10 for all editions ( not just Enterprise and Education which is all Microsoft allow you to do with Intune out of the box ! )

I will be using this script. Thanks Brad.
