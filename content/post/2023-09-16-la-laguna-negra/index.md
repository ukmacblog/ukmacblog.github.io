This afternoons [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) ride was a toughy... At the start or the current [Zwift Portal Climb](https://www.zwift.com/uk/events/series/zwift-climb-portal) for [La Laguna Negra](https://whatsonzwift.com/climb-portal/la-laguna-negra) my estimated time to summit was hovering between 42 and 45 minutes. With that in mind I started spinning my way towards the top at a fairly consistent rate but with an eye on the segment details which showed the average gradient of the last segment as 10.1% !

As I approached section 10 I was feeling a little less than fresh but still on track for a time of around 43 minutes but this last section really was tough. In my lowest gear and standing up on the pedals I was slowed to crawl but at this point being beaten was not an option. 

Its fair to say I was very pleased to see the summit banner and the pool of sweat on the floor was a good indicator of how hard this climb was. 

Glad to have another portal climb in the bank though.
