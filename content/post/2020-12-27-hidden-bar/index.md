Mac menu bar utiities are great for quick access to apps that perform simple tasks and that don't need to sit in the dock or occupy space on your desktop however they do tend to proliferate and before you know it the list of little icons at the top right of your menu bar can get out of control.

There are a couple of utilities that aim to help with this. [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12) is a simple and free to download app that allows you to quickly hide menu bar icons that you don't want on the screen all the time but still want access to. [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) is a pay-for app (currently $15) that goes quite a bit further in features but for my money (ahem) the free Hidden Bar app hits the spot. Worth a look.
