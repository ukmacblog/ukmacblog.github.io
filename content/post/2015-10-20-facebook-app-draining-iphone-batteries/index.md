According to [this article](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/15/facebook-working-on-fix-for-ios-app-battery-drain-issue/) on TechCrunch Facebook have confirmed that they are aware of a problem with their iOS app causing excessive battery drain even when the app has background refresh disabled.

If you are experiencing issues with decreased battery life recently and have the Facebook app installed you could try deleting the app and using Safari to access the site until a fix is released.
