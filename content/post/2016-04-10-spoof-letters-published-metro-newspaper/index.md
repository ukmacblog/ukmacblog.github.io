[This article](http://mashable.com/2016/04/02/fake-newspaper-letters/#YNZJAoAr6sqV) from 
[Mashable](http://mashable.com) is a few days old so apologies if you have already seen it. Definitely worth a scan !

Sam Haysom covers some of the spoof letters of [Seamus O'Reilly](http://shocko.info) that have been published in the Metro free paper here in the UK. Seamus has made an art out of sending up the anonymous letters posted in the Metro magazine by creating what I assume are accounts of fictitious events ( though I guess they could be prompted by real life ) experienced by the authors.

Maybe my sense of humour but I thought these were hilarious.
