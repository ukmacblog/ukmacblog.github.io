If you have a Facebook or Twitter account you can't have missed [seeing this article](https://bgr.com/2015/04/28/eiffel-tower-photoshop-fail-trolled-hilarious-4chan/) or one of the many variants reported all over the web in the last week or so. A Dutch food blogger named Sid Frisjes made the mistake of posting his failed attempt at the classic photo of himself pointing at the top of the Eiffel tower on Reddit and asking for some help to fix the original. The resulting stream of hilarious mickey takes quickly spread and was widely reported.

If you want to avoid becoming the subject of world wide ridicule like Sid you might be advised to check out [this article](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/ultimate-guide-taking-funny-photos-for-every-traveller.html) from Lifehack.org which was put together to help travellers to make the most of their photo opportunities and nab those funny pics first time, without the use of photo editing tools ( or Reddit ! )
