Ars technica has this [interesting article](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/01/microsofts-clever-curved-keyboard-for-ios-looks-very-smart/) about a planned new keyboard from Microsoft that will potentially make one handed typing on larger iPhones more practical.

Looks promising and seems to be yet another sign that the Microsoft of old is long gone and has been replaced by a very different animal...
